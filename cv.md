### Personal Statement

Being a certified historian, I worked for eight years in the field of culture, but decided to become a front-end developer, since this profession involves continuous self-improvement and involvement in the world of modern technologies.


I started my acquaintance with HTML, CSS and JavaScript with code-simulators, but the magic of code writing quickly fascinated me, so I started studying web development at one of the well-known online schools. Here I completed several training projects, developed skills and work speed, worked in a team in conditions close to real development.


I like challenging problems because solving them inspires me to develop further.
